Got it 👍 You want a **GitHub-ready `README.md` file** that explains your project clearly for beginners, but without including the full `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` (since those will already be in the repo).

Here’s a clean and professional version for you 👇

# 🚀 Expense Tracker Web Application (Spring Boot + MySQL + Docker)

This project is a **Spring Boot Expense Tracker Application** with **MySQL as the database**.  
It is fully containerized using **Docker** and orchestrated with **Docker Compose**.  

The goal of this project is to help beginners understand how to run a Spring Boot application and MySQL together inside containers.

## 📂 Project Structure

```

Expenses-Tracker-WebApp/
│── src/                # Spring Boot source code
│── target/             # Compiled .jar file (generated after build)
│── pom.xml             # Maven build configuration
│── Dockerfile          # Defines Spring Boot app image
│── docker-compose.yml  # Defines services (Spring Boot + MySQL)

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/expenses-tracker-webapp.git
cd expenses-tracker-webapp
````

### 2. Build & Start Containers

```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### 3. Check Running Containers

```bash
docker ps
```

### 4. Access the Application

* App: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
* MySQL: `localhost:3306`

  * Username: `root`
  * Password: `root`

---

## 🔎 Useful Docker Commands

* **Stop containers**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

* **Stop and remove everything (including DB volume)**

  ```bash
  docker-compose down -v
  ```

* **View logs of your Spring Boot app**

  ```bash
  docker logs Expensetracker -f
  ```

* **Rebuild the application if code changes**

  ```bash
  docker-compose up --build -d
  ```

---

## 📝 Beginner Notes

* Use the **service name (`mysql`)** in the database URL instead of `localhost`.
* `volumes` ensure that your MySQL data is not lost when containers restart.
* `depends_on` makes sure MySQL starts before Spring Boot.
* `restart: always` ensures containers auto-start if your system reboots.

---

## 📸 How It Works (Architecture)

1. **MySQL container** runs the database service.
2. **Spring Boot container** connects to MySQL using the internal Docker network.
3. Both containers are managed together by **Docker Compose**.
4. You can access the Spring Boot application on port `8080`.

## ✅ Tech Stack

* **Java 17**
* **Spring Boot**
* **MySQL**
* **Maven**
* **Docker & Docker Compose**

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add a **frontend UI** with React/Angular.
* Deploy on **AWS ECS / Kubernetes**.
* Integrate **CI/CD pipeline** with Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

Would you like me to also **create a container-architecture diagram (Spring Boot ↔ MySQL ↔ Docker Compose)** as an image for the README? That makes the GitHub page much more beginner-friendly and visual.
